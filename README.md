# Bitsy Editor

The [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) editor as a desktop application.

Built with [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate).

## Building

There is no automated build yet, so you'll have to build the application yourself.

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) if necessary
2. Clone or download this repository
2. `cd` into the repository
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run release`

The application will be packaged into the `dist` directory of the repository.

Note: this has only been verified on macOS, but it should work on Windows and Linux as well.
